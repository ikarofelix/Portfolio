              I'm super into tech and all the amazing stuff it can do. That's why I got into web
              development – it's this awesome combo of being creative, solving problems, and always
              picking up new things. What really gets me excited is making apps that you can
              interact with, and they look really cool too. Like, they can actually make a
              difference in people's lives.

              I'm one of those people who's always curious about how things tick. Right now, I'm
              really getting into how systems are put together, especially things like databases and
              servers. I'm even thinking of getting more into Back-End development down the road.
              I'm always on the lookout for new knowledge – I'm a total learning junkie. Challenges
              keep me fired up, and I love starting from scratch and building stuff up. Oh, and by
              the way, I'm pretty handy with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Firebase, MySQL,
              GraphQL, NodeJS and some other stuff.
